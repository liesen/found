Evaluates an expression whenever the file system changes. The expression
should work just like `find(1)` (with some modifications).

Examples:

  `found . -iname \*.c -exec make` (though `exec` doesn't work yet.)


Based on `find` in GNU findutils (http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/), and
fswatch (https://github.com/alandipert/fswatch).

Other tools, e.g. watchman (https://github.com/facebook/watchman) and
Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) can do the same thing and much more, but I find
them to not be in the Unix spirit.
